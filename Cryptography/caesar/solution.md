Decrypt this message.

## Solution
I dont know what caesar cipher is doing in medium difficulty challenges. 

Open provided file in any text editor - you will see this:
~~~
picoCTF{dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds}
~~~

You will probably notice that only part of the flag is encrypted. Use [this](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) site to decrypt "dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds".

I recommend using bruteforce method, and choose first string in which you will recognize any word that make sense.
