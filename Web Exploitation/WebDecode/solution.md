Lets check two other sites:

about.html:

We definitely have to check source code. There is nothing interesting, except this section:

This looks like a encoded flag. String lenght looks like its a Base64. We have to decode it. Lets use (CyberChef)[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/]. In left panel, select and drag **From Base64** to our recipe. Paste encoded string, and thats it.
