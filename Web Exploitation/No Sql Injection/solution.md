## Challenge description:
Can you try to get access to this website to get the flag?

## Solution
In this challenge, author provide us with source files. Lets check them.

### admin.html
Credential JSON is somewhere here.

### index.html
Login credentials are sent to the server with POST method and json content type.

### package.json
Nothing interesting here

### server.js
There are some usefull informations here:
- first name - pico
- last name - player
- email - picoplayer355@picoctf.org
- password - randomly generated

We have found that credentials are being stored not in SQL database, but in JSON file. Lets try to perform a NoSQL injection.

But first, lets check can we see the admin page by providing /admin at the end of site url.

We can. But this gives us nothing
