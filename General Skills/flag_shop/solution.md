There's a flag shop selling stuff, can you buy a flag? Source. Connect with nc **address**

## Solution
This was pretty fun challenge to play around. I found that we can overflow some kind of buffer while buying flags, and this will add funds to our *account*. And then we will be able to buy the real flag.
