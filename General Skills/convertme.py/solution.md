## Challenge description:
Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.

Description is asking us to run the script. So lets run it. Again, you can use [this online interpreter](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

Convert given number to binary notation in order to receive the flag.
